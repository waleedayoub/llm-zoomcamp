    "# 1.3 Retrieval and Search - Notes\n",
    "- Before jumping into using elasticsearch to index our documents, we're going to use the search engine build by DTC\n",
    "- In order to do that, I need to import minsearch.py (the search engine library)\n",
    "- Once that's done, we need to understand a few things about how `minsearch` is implemented:\n",
    "    - `minsearch.Index()` is the method used to index a document and takes a few parameters: `text_fields` and `keyword_fields`\n",
    "        - text_fields: the fields we use to search\n",
    "        - keyword_fields: the fields used to group the data (i.e. similar to a WHERE clause in SQL)\n",
    "    - So for example, if you pass a query like: ***\"How do I execute a command in a running docker container?\"*** the search engine would filter results by `keyword_fields` and would search through `text_fields`\n",
    "    - index.fit() is the method used to specify the document you want to *fit* your Index to. So in this case, you would pass it the document containing all the data with the relevant keyword_fields and text_fields\n",
    "    - index.search():\n",
    "        - This is the method used to actually search the fitted document for the specific question\n",
    "        - All the `text_fields` you search through are given equal weighting. If you want to change that, you can use a parameter called `boost` which allows you to ***relatively*** overweight or underweight certain `text_fields` by passing it a dictionary with `{text_field: weight}`\n",
    "        - There are two other parameters, that are pretty straightforward: `filter_dict` which just lets you filter based on a `keyword_fields` again as a dict of the form `{\"keyword_fields\": \"value\"}` entry and `num_results` which just limits the number of elements it returns"

      "answer: First off, make sure you're running the latest version of Docker for Windows, which you can download from here. Sometimes using the menu to \"Upgrade\" doesn't work (which is another clear indicator for you to uninstall, and reinstall with the latest version)\n",
      "If docker is stuck on starting, first try to switch containers by right clicking the docker symbol from the running programs and switch the containers from windows to linux or vice versa\n",
      "[Windows 10 / 11 Pro Edition] The Pro Edition of Windows can run Docker either by using Hyper-V or WSL2 as its backend (Docker Engine)\n",
      "In order to use Hyper-V as its back-end, you MUST have it enabled first, which you can do by following the tutorial: Enable Hyper-V Option on Windows 10 / 11\n",

      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",
